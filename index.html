                    <p class=" text-2xl leading-relaxed text-black mb-4">What Causes Tooth Discoloration?</p>
                    <p class=" mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Tooth discoloration occurs due to a variety of reasons:</p>
                    <p class=" mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base"> <strong>- Diet: </strong>Frequent consumption of coffee, tea, wine, and certain fruits can stain your teeth.</p>
                    <p class=" mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base"> <strong>-Tobacco Use:</strong> Smoking or chewing tobacco significantly contributes to yellowing teeth.</p>
                    <p class=" mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base"> <strong>- Medications: </strong> Certain medications can cause tooth discoloration as a side effect.</p>
                    <p class=" mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base"> <strong>- Aging: </strong> Over time, the outer layer of enamel wears down, revealing the yellowish dentin beneath.</p>
                    <p class=" mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base"> <strong>- Poor Oral Hygiene: </strong> Inadequate brushing and flossing can lead to plaque and tartar buildup, which stains teeth.</p>
